# Inheritance Simulator

This interactive web application is designed to help visualize and understand the concept of genetic inheritance, specifically for autosomal recessive conditions. It's particularly aimed at making this complex topic accessible and engaging for young children.

## Features

- **Interactive Baby Generation**: Click a button to 'have a baby' and see instantly whether the child needs 'extra love' (representing the expression of a recessive trait).
- **Adjustable Probability**: Use a slider to change the likelihood of having a baby that needs 'extra love', allowing for exploration of different genetic scenarios.
- **Visual Representation**: Babies are represented by colorful icons - green for those without the trait, and red for those needing 'extra love'.
- **Simple Statistics**: Keep track of the total number of babies and how many need 'extra love'.
- **Reset Functionality**: Start over at any time to begin a new simulation.

## Educational Value

This simulator helps demonstrate several key concepts in genetics and probability:
1. The random nature of genetic inheritance
2. How probability applies to each individual event (each 'baby')
3. The concept of traits that may not appear in every generation

It's designed to be engaging for young children while also being informative for older students and adults who are new to these concepts.
